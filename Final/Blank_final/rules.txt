A Final variable must be cumpulsarily initialised either at declaration time or in the constructor or static block(in case of constants).
hence FINAL variable "DOSEN'T HAVE DEFAULT VALUE".

example:
class Test
{
final int i;
main()
{
}

}
gives error as final variable is not defined in the constructor as well as at class level.


if we use blank final variable and have many constructors in our class, then every constructor should initialise blank final variable (done via constructor chaining
)
