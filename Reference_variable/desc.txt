A reference variable can be of only one type, and once declared, that type
can never be changed (although the object it references can change).
■ A reference is a variable, so it can be reassigned to other objects, (unless the
reference is declared final ).
■ A reference variable's type determines the methods that can be invoked on
the object the variable is referencing.
■ A reference variable can refer to any object of the same type as the declared
reference, or—this is the big one—it can refer to any subtype of the
declared type!
■ A reference variable can be declared as a class type or an interface type. If
the variable is declared as an interface type, it can reference any object of any
class that implements the interface.
